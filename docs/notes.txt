Plant Alert App design notes
****************************

Both mobile and wide-screen use of the application must be considered to be first-class use cases.

Lists of occurrences on a narrow screen should use a list (based around a Bootstrap accordion format, but with the
expanded view separated into a separate 'screen'. On desktops the expanded view should instead use the right-hand column.

The map view should be a modal full-page overlay on both desktop and mobile.

Taxon picker should be full screen on mobile, but expand in-situ on desktop.



Saving of records should be automatic in the background, occurring as soon as a network connection is available.
(i.e. no explicit save option)

Main screen should display a top banner warning if a connection has been lost and some changes remain unsaved.
