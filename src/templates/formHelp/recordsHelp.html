        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Plant names</h6>
        <p class="card-text">If possible, please enter the scientific or common name of the plant, but don't worry if you don't know the full details.
            The list of suggested names includes a very wide range of both native and horticultural plants, but if the name you need
            isn't on the list then you can still type it in.
        </p>
        <p>Remember to record only plants that are in flower. Plants with only buds or seed heads don't count and nor do ferns!</p>
        <p>Please record only flowers growing in wild places. You can include weeds in gardens, lawns or verges, but cultivated plants in or near gardens behave very differently so we'd like to keep them out of our results.</p>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Photos</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Photos of the plant will help us confirm your record. Please provide a picture showing the whole plant, but it will
            also help us if you can provide close-up views of the flowers and leaves.

        <h5 class="card-title">Locating your finds</h5>
        <p>If you are using a mobile device in the field then each record should be assigned a GPS-based geo-reference automatically.</p>
        <p>Alternatively you can type a grid-reference (Ordnance Survey or OSI grid-reference) in the grid-reference field or click on the map.</p>
        <p>By default, records will be automatically assigned the location you gave for the survey, so it's not required to enter individual grid-references.</p>
