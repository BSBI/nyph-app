            will be remembered on your device, but you will need to click '<a href="/app/survey/save" data-navigo="survey/save">save all</a>' (on the <i>Your lists</i> menu) once you have a network connection again.

        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Plant names</h6>
        <p class="card-text">If possible, please enter the name of the plant, but if you don't know the name then take a photo instead and we'll try to identify it.</p>
        <p>Remember to record only plants that are in flower. Plants with only buds or seed heads don't count and nor do ferns!</p>
        <p>Please record only flowers growing in wild places. You can include weeds in gardens, lawns or verges, but cultivated plants in gardens behave very differently, so we'd like to keep them out of our results.</p>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Photos</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Photographs of the plant will help us confirm your record. Please provide a picture showing the whole plant, but it will
            also help us if you can provide close-up views of the flowers and leaves.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Please send each of your finds separately.</strong> To analyse your results we need to be able to store a record of each plant. Combining multiple records in a single image, or as text in the comments field creates additional work for our volunteers and may mean that some of your finds are overlooked.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Locating your finds</h5>
        <p>If you are using a mobile device in the field then each record should be assigned a GPS-based geo-reference automatically.</p>
        <p>Alternatively you can type a grid-reference (Ordnance Survey or OSI grid-reference) in the grid-reference field or click on the map.</p>
        <p>Records will be automatically assigned the location you gave for the survey, so it's not necessary to enter individual grid-references.</p>
