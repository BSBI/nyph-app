<p>In this section, please list the ornamental plants that are spreading in your
garden and are difficult to control.</p>
<p> Many plants in your garden will spread and this is a sign that they are growing well. We only want to know about those that are spreading to an extent that
    you have to control them to prevent them overgrowing other plants or parts of your garden where you do not want them.</p>
<p>Please note in this project we are dealing with ornamental plants only (no vegetables, no weeds -
    unless they are ornamentals that you now regard as weeds).</p>

        <p class="card-text">You can enter as many plant records as you need. To add another record click the 'Add a plant' button.</p>
        <p class="card-text">If you are currently online then the entries will be saved as you go, automatically. Otherwise the records
            will be remembered on your device, but you will need to click '<a href="/app/survey/save" data-navigo="survey/save">save all</a>' (on the Surveys menu) when you have a network connection again.

        <p class="card-text">If possible, please enter the scientific or common name of the plant, but don't worry if you dont know the full details.
            The list of suggested names includes a very wide range of both native and horticultural plants, but if the name you need
            isn't on the list then you can still type it in.

        <p class="card-text">Photos of the plant will help us confirm your record. Please provide a picture showing the whole plant, but it will
            also help us if you can provide close-up views of the flowers and leaves.
