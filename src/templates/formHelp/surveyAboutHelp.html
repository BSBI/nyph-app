        <h5 class="card-title">Localising your records</h5>
        <p class="card-text">To make sense of the national coverage of the records we receive, we need to know the approximate location
        of your garden. Usually a postcode works well for this, but you can provide a grid-reference if you prefer (in Ireland please use a grid-reference as we don't yet have a way to convert postcodes).
            We also need a place name, as a way to double check that the postcode or grid-reference makes sense.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Please don't provide your full address, as we would need to remove that from our data.</strong></p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Your name and email</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Both of these are optional, but providing an email address is important if you want to return
            to your survey later or to revise your records. It is also really useful for our experts to be able to contact you
            if we have questions about the records that you've sent.
        </p>
        <p>We'd like to be able to include your name with the records in our archive, but your email address won't be stored long-term
            after your plant records have been checked.</p>
