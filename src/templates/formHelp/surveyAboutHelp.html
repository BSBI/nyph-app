        <p class="card-text">To make sense of the national coverage of the records we receive, we need to know the starting point for your survey and, ideally the location for each individual record.
            We also need a place name, as a way to double-check that the postcode or grid-reference makes sense.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Please don't provide your full address, as we would need to remove that from our data.</strong></p>

        <p class="card-text">We need your contact details so that we can email you a link
            to your survey. It is also really useful for our experts to be able to contact you
            if we have questions about the records that you've sent.
        </p>
        <p>You can choose whether to include your name with the records in our archive - we'd like your efforts to be acknowledged properly. Your email address will be treated as confidential and won't be stored long-term,
            after your plant records have been checked.</p>
