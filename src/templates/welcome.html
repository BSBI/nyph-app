<p>Using your experience as gardener, please help us identify
potentially invasive plant species in gardens before they become a problem for
biodiversity and conservation in wild situations in Britain or Ireland.</p>
<p>The survey is divided into three sections and usually takes between 15 and 20 minutes to complete. You can pause and come back
    later at any point.</p>
<p>The information that you provide will be used by the <a href="https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/agroecology-water-resilience/" target="_blank" title="CAWR">Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience</a> at Coventry University and by
    <a href="https://bsbi.org/" target="_blank" title="Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland">BSBI</a> for a
    study of invasive plants. We'll include your plant records in a permanent archive held by BSBI, to help us track
    long term changes in plant distribution.</p>
<p>To follow up any queries about the survey we request that you please provide your name and email address. You can choose whether or not
    to include your name in our archive of plant records. Your email address (if provided) will be
confidential and won't be archived.</p>
<p>A summary of records will appear on the project website, but the full survey details including the exact location of your garden will only be accessible to the research team.</p>
